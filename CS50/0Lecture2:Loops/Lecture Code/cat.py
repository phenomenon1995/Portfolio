#you can use underscore for temp variables that you'll only use onces
#Pythonically, the code print("meow\n"*3, end=" ") will do the same things, but it's ugly
#continue and break are used in loops
#make infinite loop that breaks when user gives you the input that you expect and then break loop and proceed
